Hi! I'm a student who is interested in deep reinforcement learning (DRL). My recent research focuses on designing theoretically sound policy gradient algorithms and improving their generalization performance.

I am looking for highly motivated assistant professors. If you are working at a university ranked in the top 50 of the QS Rankings and have a reasonable background in RL, feel free to contact me through [zhengpengxie@hkust-gz.edu.cn](mailto:zhengpengxie@hkust-gz.edu.cn)!
